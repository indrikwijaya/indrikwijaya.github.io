In this project, I evaluated different clustering algorithms to draw meaningful patterns from short time-series genomics data. Popular algorithms such as K-Means, as well as specially-developed algorithm for short time-series such as [STEM](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2105-7-191) are analyzed.

### Credit Fraud Prediction

[![Final Presentation Poster](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Open_Research_Poster-blue?logo=adobe-acrobat-reader&logoColor=white)](pdf/credit_fraud_prediction.pdf)

In this class project, my group studied various machine learning algorithms to predict classical problem in machine learning, credit fraud. Surprisingly, decision tree classifiers that typically have higher tendency to overfit the data seem to perform better against robust ensemble methods like Random Forest or AdaBoost. We hypothesized that this happens due to the bias in the datasets. Here, we proposed some suggestions to overcome this bias.

### Detect Food Trends from Facebook Posts: Co-occurence Matrix, Lift and PPMI

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](projects/detect-food-trends-facebook.html)

<div style="text-align: justify">First I build co-occurence matrices of ingredients from Facebook posts from 2011 to 2015. Then, to identify interesting and rare ingredient combinations that occur more than by chance, I calculate Lift and PPMI metrics. Lastly, I plot time-series data of identified trends to validate my findings. Interesting food trends have emerged from this analysis.</div>

### Detect Spam Messages: TF-IDF and Naive Bayes Classifier

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](projects/detect-spam-nlp.html)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/detect-spam-messages-nlp/blob/master/detect-spam-nlp.ipynb)

<div style="text-align: justify">In order to predict whether a message is spam, first I vectorized text messages into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand using Bag-of-Word and TF-IDF. Then I trained a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between normal and spam messages. Finally, with the trained model, I classified unlabel messages into normal or spam.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">After my team preprocessed a dataset of 10K credit applications and built machine learning models to predict credit default risk, I built an interactive user interface with Streamlit and hosted the web app on Heroku server.</div>

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/kaggle-house-price/blob/master/ames-house-price.ipynb)

<div style="text-align: justify">I performed comprehensive EDA to understand important variables, handled missing values, outliers, performed feature engineering, and ensembled machine learning models to predict house prices. My best model had Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12293.919, ranking <b>95/15502</b>, approximately <b>top 0.6%</b> in the Kaggle leaderboard.</div>
